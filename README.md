## Project
utilizing avaialble data, I created a series of Datasets that would allow me to pull Demographics data using FIPS or US county codes. This will enhance some reporting strucures and then allow me to link these FIPS numbers back to individual US Zip Codes/Postal Codes. This will give my clients a better understanding of the demographics of their attendees locations.
